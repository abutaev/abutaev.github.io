    <ul>
      <li> space of functions of bounded mean oscillation and its subspaces </li>
      <li> analysis on metric measure spaces </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you are a second-year or higher UFV student interested to gain experience with math research, you are welcome to 
    reach out to discuss possible research opportunities. 
    Participating in a research project can strengthen your resume, especially if you are considering graduate studies.
    It can also help you to decide a future career path.
