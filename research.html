    <h3> For UFV students </h3>
    <p>
    If you are a second-year or higher UFV student interested to gain experience with math research, you are welcome to 
    reach out to discuss possible research opportunities. 
    Participating in a research project can strengthen your resume, especially if you are considering graduate studies.
    It can also help you to decide a future career path. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My research is supported by NSERC, so I can supervise Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) holders. 
      If you plan to apply to USRA for Summer 2026, check
